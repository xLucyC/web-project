<h3><b>Some projects i have done or worked on.</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>
	<h3>Theatre Booking System</h3>
	<p>In college i used .vb with visual studio to create a booking system for a theatre.<br>
	The theatre had 300 seats split into different sections with different prices per area<br>
	I had to make a visual interface that diplayed the layout of the seats and the stage<br>
	as a reference. I colour coded the seats depending on whether they are accessability,<br>
	booked, reserved or free. and made it so selecting a seat that was available would bring<br> 
	up a form with the information and to be able to book the seat which stored the information<br>
	and changes the status of the seat in the visual interface.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><b>Summer Activity Booking System</b></h3>
	<p>I made a booking system for a summer scheme that was run by my Thai Boxing gym and Junior Youth club<br>
	this was a program that put on free activities for kids in the area during the summer holidays. the booking<br>
	system needed to be able to take all the childrens and parents information aswell as linking them to what<br>
	activities they were going to be signed up for, I made a form to take in all the childs and parent information.<br>
	using visual basic studio and one to link a child onto an activity register and then another to recall the,full information.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><b>Youth Club Emergency contact and Planner app.</b></h3>	
	<p>This was the first app I made for android and it entailed making a booking page to take a childs<br>
	information and emergency/medical information and to be able to recall it with a search function, <br>
	I created a page for planning with a calender to mark events and a rota underneath for staff <br>
	then i created a noticeboard page with a forum chat to discuss topics on. This was a great experience<br>
	and would love to make more apps for android in the future.
