<h3> Galactic Odyssey: A Text Based Space Survival RPG. </h3>
<p>This Game is a python 3 based game with backend only, it was created as part of a group project in which I was the lead programmer. <br>
The goal of this game is to find your way back home without running out of Fuel and maybe even finding hidden secrets along the way.<br>
Feel free to play the game or browse the code to see how it was put together.

<h3><b>Uniq</b></h3>
<p>Uniq is a game i started development on a while ago with my brother in law, it is a 2.5D platformer where the paths and ability to overcome obstacles is decided by your choices in character creation.<br>
This game offers a unique way to play and explore the strenghts and weaknesses of everyone whilst showing everyone can reach their goal by taking advantage of their strengths.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to technical issues and a hard drive issue and devlopment of hte game was lost other than a few screenshots and progress videos, however due to this the game was<br>
originally being built on Unity and now can switch and start development in Unreal 5.2 which should improve the outcome of the game. This also gave a chance to reflect on past experience<br>
and look at ways in which the game can be built up foundationally to improve it overall.
