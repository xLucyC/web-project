    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
    <p>Hi, My name is Lucy, I am 27 years old. I work as a Painter and Decorator and a Indie Games Developer.<br>
    I live in Manchester and have done all my life. I have been coding since Seconday School.<br>
	I started of learning with 'HTML 4' to build basic websites without any styling, I always had a<br>
    goal of wanting to be involved in the development of games and from there I starting to find more <br>
	ways of using different languages to create, manipulate and add on to games.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I went to Sixth Form College to study Maths, Politics and Computing, in which i learned<br>
	how to use visual studio and the language alongside it aswell as enhancing my knowledege in<br>
	computer science. Due to complications with my teachers and the IT faculty, I unfortunately<br>
    had to leave that course after the first year and picked up finance. Throughout the rest of my time<br>
    at college I continued to work on my skills I had learned and even created some databases for local businesses</p> 	
	<br>
	<p>Alongside technology and gaming I was also heavily invested in Muay Thai and spent around 16 years<br>
	practising it and competing, I was the youngest instructor outside of thailand at 15 and I went and represented<br>
	the country with the rest of the England team at the international games with over 50 countries and won Silver<br>
	just missing out on gold by decision. My favourite colour is pink and it is also the colour of respect in thailand.<br>
	Due to being involved in Muay Thai and holding alot of the Thai values and following the guidelines I see myself as Buddhist.

    <h3>Favourite Games</h3>
    <p>I have had alot of favourite games over the years that has given me a very broad experience<br>
	In what games as a medium can do, the benefits of it and the ways it can be used, So here is a list<br>
	of games that I have enjoyed over the years, why I have enjoyed them and how they have inspired me.
	<br>
    <ul>
	  <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape"><b>Runescape</b></a>
	  <p>I have been playing this game for over 17 years with nearly 300 Days played, i have watched evolve from a browser based java game<br>
	  to a what it is today. It has always been a game where you are free to do as you please and aren't really<br>
	  forced in any direction unless you have things you want to aim for. The social aspect of an MMO also improves<br>
	  the experience in places but also it's fun to play alone too.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy">Final Fantasy</b></a>
	  <p>Final Fantasy 7 was the first Game in the series I played enough to complete the game, i spent hundreds<br>
	  of hours in this game, restarting it to be able to play it through again. Although it isn't my faourite in the series now<br>
	  it still remains one of the best, the story-telling in these games is always top-tier and even characters that spanned<br>
	  from the very first game to the modern releases.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)"><b>Halo</b></a>
	  <p>Halo was the first game that fully introduced me to FPS games, I fell in love with it from the first time i played it<br>
	  This was also my first major experience with online multiplayer and more competetive splitscreen games. the skills<br>
	  i learned in that game have still translated over to this day and Halo also introduced me to level creation with a level editor<br>
	  being able to make my own level for me, my freinds and the community to play was a great experience, and still is.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls"><b>The Elder Scrolls</b></a>
	  <p>The Elder Scrolls series is on i didn't get into until later on with Skyrim, i have put thousands of hours into it since.<br> 
	  with the open world, the accesability of modding tools and the ease of use allows for so much variety in each playthrough<br>
	  whether you want to add new levels, weapons or armour, characters, enemys and animals or you want to imporve the graphics<br>
	  with shaders and ENBs, Maybe even the physics or animations with FNIS and skeleton tools. I did eventually go back and play<br>
	  all the other games in the series and there is alot of things i prefer in oblivion that never carried over to skyrim, but it still remains<br>
	  my favourite in the series.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU"><b>IMVU</b></a>
	  <p>IMVU is a game that i have probably spent the least amount of time on out of the games in this list but the ability to be able to<br>
	  create your own models for clothing, character models, housing and more, and then list them up for sale on the in game marketplace<br>
	  which would then in-turn earn you credits for people purchasing your creations, allowing you to buy anything that you want in the game.<br>
	  this gave motivation to be creative and make models that other people would want.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros."><b>Super Smash Bros.</b></a>
	  <p>This game just takes top spot over tekken as my favourite fighting game due to the expansive roster of characters and ip's, the ability<br>
	  to have up to 8 people fighting at once and 4 player free for all's leads to a slightly less competetive game than a 1v1 game would<br>
	  although that is still an option in this game and is how the esports format works. This game shows that certain genres don't always<br>
      have to be ultra competetive or fun and casual exclusively. 	  
	  </p>
	  </li>
	    <li>    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League"><b>Rocket League</b></a>
	  <p>I have been playing Rocket League since 2016, i have put about 300 hours into it since. the thing that draws me to this game<br>
	  is the fact that due the the mechanics of the game, even with previous gaming experience people have to start from the bottom<br>
	  and work on mechanics and prediction of the ball and other players to improve. it's a game that takes dedication and practise<br>
	  to even compete with people in the lower half of the games skill range. The other things that draws me to this game is the community<br>
	  they are always pushing the game further and doing things that were thought impossible, then there is the e-sports and showmatch side<br>
	  which is great to see some of hte best players in the world in a game that is one of the easiest to follow even without game knowledge<br>
	  but also the most consistent action out of sports and esports.
	  </p>
	  </li>
	   <li>    <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite_Wiki"><b>Fortnite</b></a>
	  <p>Fortnite is a game i have played on and off, originally starting in season 1 as the hype was just starting off, the thing that keeps drawing<br>
	  me back to this game is the creative aspect and Epic's willingness to take risks and put out whatever content they want. the community creation<br>
	  aspect is great allowing people to create, call of duty game modes, death runs, story experiences, escape rooms and puzzle games and all while<br>
	  still rewarding the player no matter what they choose to play.

    <h3>Favourite Shows and Films</h3>
    <p> </p>
	<h3><b>Shows</b></h3>
<ul>
        <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)"><b>Loki</b></a>
	<p>Loki is my favourite out of the Super hero Series with The Flash and Supergirl close behind. I love the concepts of how time works in the show and exploration of multiverses.<b>
	I also love that things that are as powerful as the infinity stones in the universe are practically useless and paperweights to higher powers. I love super hero films and shows as<b>
	I love science and the concepts that are explored in these films along with the action to keep it entertaining all around.
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_(TV_series)"><b>Lucifer</b></a>
	<p>Lucifer is my favourite show because it shows a character which is perceived to be inherently evil trying to live out his life and be free from his past,. This show displays his<br>
	struggle in changing and tries to fight it before eventually everyone sees him more how he really is. 
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine"><b>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</b></a>
	<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine is one of my favourite shows because i love everybody in the cast and it always makes me laugh no matter how many times i rewatch the series or an episode<br>
	I still find myself laughint at the same parts as i did before and noticing new things evertime on top of that. I can come back to this show at anytime in any mood and still enjoy it. 
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfen_Lied"><b>Elfen Lied</b></a>
	<p>Elfen lied is a great showcase of my anime taste, i haven't watched much recently but when i do its usually psychological thrillers or romance and even both together.
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Films</b></h3>
<ul>
        <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hero_6_(film)"><b>Big Hero 6</b></a>
	<p>Big Hero 6 is one of my Favourite films of all time, I love robotics and the advancement of technology and this film explores it in a fun and unique way<br>
	its a great family film and is good even rewatching. I have watched this film way too many times but still enjoy it every time.
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII:_Advent_Children"><b>Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children</b></a>
	<p>One of the first anime films i have ever watched and still one of my favourites to this day, it links to one of my favourite video game series which gives it extra credit<br>
	but i love the story and seeing all my characters and attacks etc in movie form at the time was great.
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke"><b>Princess Mononoke</b></a>
	<p>Princess Mononoke is my favourite out of the studio ghibli films, it explores a girl who is raised by wildlife dealing with humanity and nature together and dealing with<br>
	a war between humanity and nature which almost destroys the world.
	</p>
	</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moana_(2016_film)"><b>Moana</b></a>
	<p>Moana is my favourite disney film, The songs in the film are my favourite out of any film with aristocats a close second. i love the casting choice and story on this film<br>
	with the exploration of gods and demi gods, and dealing with the wrath of distrubing nature just for humanity's gain.
